# Cplusplus

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
To build an application for Airgead Banking to show the power of investing and of using compound interest.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
Something I beleive I did particularily well is getting the display output formatted the way that was requested by Airgead Banking.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am not sure what I could have done better to make the code more enhanced.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it difficult to take the user input, get it computed, and ouput it into the display. I found the solutions to put all the pieces I could not get together by searching online for examples.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I beleive will transfer from this project to future work are building displays, taking input, and displaying the computed output.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I achieved this by making sure my code was readable and followed common naming conventions.
